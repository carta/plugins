# Carta Fund Admin

Claude Code plugin that gives Claude access to Carta Fund Admin data.

## How it works

This plugin provides **skills** that teach Claude how to query fund metrics, regulatory reporting, performance benchmarks, and more via the Carta MCP server at `https://mcp.app.carta.com/mcp`.

## Installation

Install from the marketplace via `/plugin`, or add the Carta MCP server manually:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http carta https://mcp.app.carta.com/mcp
claude plugin marketplace add carta/plugins
claude plugin install carta-fund-admin
```

After installing, restart Claude Code and run `/mcp` to complete OAuth authentication.
